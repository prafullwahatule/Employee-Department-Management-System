# Employee & Department Management System (EDMS)

This project demonstrates a **SQL-based database system** for managing Employees and Departments in an organization using **MySQL**.  
It is designed as a **learning project** to practice database design, data insertion, and query execution for real-world business scenarios.

---

## 📌 Features
- Database schema for **Departments** and **Employees**
- **Sample data (INSERT scripts)** to populate tables
- **Situational queries** for:
  - `INSERT` (hiring employees, creating departments)
  - `SELECT` with `WHERE` filters
  - `GROUP BY` (salary analysis, employee count, budget summary)
  - `CONCAT` (creating full names, greetings, IDs)
  - `UPDATE` (salary revisions, email updates, department renaming)
  - `DELETE` (removing employees/departments)
  - Schema modifications (`ALTER`, adding/removing columns, renaming tables)
